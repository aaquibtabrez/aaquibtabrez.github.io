I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) in the Department of Computer Science, where I am advised by [Brad Hayes](http://www.bradhayes.info/) in the [Collaborative AI and Robotics (CAIRO) Lab](http://www.cairo-lab.com/). 

I previously received a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from NITK Surathkal (India) in 2014 and a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from CU, specializing in Controls and Robotics, in 2019.


I work at the intersection of explainability and human-robot interaction. In my research, I aim to leverage and enhance human-machine communication to achieve value alignment and foster appropriate trust within human-robot teams. My broader interests encompass Explainable AI, Reinforcement Learning, Multimodal Human-Machine Communication, and Human-AI Interaction.

**Other Interests:** I enjoy reading philosophy and literature. Some of my favorite topics are: existentialism, stoicism, sufism, and taoism. I also love spending time on poetry, some of my favorite poets include Emily Dickinson and Rumi. I also enjoy music and dancing, especially swing dancing. My primary outdoor activities are running and hiking. Some of my favorite hikes include: Quandary Peak in winter, the Seven Sisters in England, and both the Old Man of Storr Walk and The Quiraing in Scotland.
