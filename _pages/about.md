I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Interactive and Collaborative Autonomous Robotics (ICAROS)](https://icaros.usc.edu/) lab at the University of Southern California, advised by [Stefanos Nikolaidis](https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/). I did my Ph.D. at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) in the Department of Computer Science, where I was advised by [Brad Hayes](http://www.bradhayes.info/) in the [Collaborative AI and Robotics (CAIRO) Lab](http://www.cairo-lab.com/).


I previously received a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from NITK Surathkal (India) in 2014 and a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from CU, specializing in Controls and Robotics, in 2019.

I work at the intersection of explainability and human-robot teaming, focusing on enhancing communication to achieve shared understanding and collaboration, fostering appropriate trust and reliance in human-machine teams. My broader interests encompass Explainable AI, Reinforcement Learning, Multimodal Human-Machine Communication, and Human-AI Interaction.
