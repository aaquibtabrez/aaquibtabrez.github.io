New paper accepted to RSS 2023, ["Autonomous Justification for Enabling Explainable Decision Support in Human-Robot Teaming"](https://aaquibtabrez.github.io/assets/pdf/publications/rss23.pdf), in which we explore the role of justification in human-robot collaboration, introduce a novel framework for appropriately timing explanations, and evaluate different types of justifications to enhance user trust and decision-making in teaming scenarios.
