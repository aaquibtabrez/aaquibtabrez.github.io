I'm excited to share that I have successfully defended my PhD thesis!

A huge thank you to my committee members: Brad Hayes, Alessandro Roncone, Dan Szafir, and Sonia Chernova for their guidance and support throughout this journey.

Thesis Title: [**Mediating Trust and Influence in Human-Robot Teams via Multimodal Communication and Explanation for Mental Model Alignment**](https://www.proquest.com/openview/44125401f38c54e69730ed3085f4055c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y)
